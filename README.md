# C++ Basic Data Types
The following project will give the user a basic introduction on how basic data types work in C++ programming. This project covers, but is not limited to, the following data types: integers, doubles, booleans and characters. It is important to note that there are other basic data types such as floats, however, for now what we cover will serve the purposes you need.

## Declaring Variables
In programming we need a way to store the information that we are working with in a safe place; the way we do this is through something called **variables**. Variables are ways of holding different pieces of data in Computer science. Below demonstrates an example of declaring a variable in C++ programming:

```c++
int number; //Declares variable
number = 1; //Assigns value
```
You can also combine the declaration of variables in C++ programming into one line which is demonstrated below:

```c++
int number = 1;
```
When programming with variables you will only need to declare the variable once.
